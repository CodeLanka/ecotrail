<p>The following must be done for the service to run correctly</p>

<ul>
	<li>You must make sure a file named <b>key.json</b> is present with all the previous keys you found inserted to the path '/usr/src/app' of the container in the format {"email": "you@something.com", "key": ["KEY1", "KEY2", "KEY3", "KEY4"]}</li>
	<li>A Tree resource container must also be running in the same host.  So find someone who has a Tree &#x1F333; &#x1F9DA; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x1F3C3; &#x1F4A7;</li>
	<li>You may use your Water resource on TWO TREE resoures. After that, Water will run out. Its a scarce resource. So be wise</li>
