<h2>Mahaeliya National Park</h2>
<p>Mahaeliya or Horton Plains National park is an important ecosystem where three of the major rivers; Mahaweli, Kelani and Walawe has their headwaters.</p>



<p>The plains are a diverse ecosystem where rare plants and animals are found. It consists of two main parts, grasslands and evergreens. The climate keeps an intricate balance between these two.</p>
<p>Mahaeliya Plains is the home to many species of animals as well. The ever present Sambar deer and the elusive Leopards as well as an array of birds dominate the plains.</p>
<p>The plains consist of several attractions including the sheer precifice known as the "World's End", the concealed waterfall "Baker's Falls" and Sri Lanka's 2nd tallest mountain, Kirigalpoththa.</p>

<p>Mahaeliya is however under threat by plastic pollution. Some tourists who visit the place are themselves 'animals' in behavior and have no love for fragile environment they are in. In addition to that, a severe case of forest dieback occurs in the plains which is not yet properly described</p>
<h3>Did you know: There have been some prehistoric findings in Mahaeliya which date parallel with the Balangoda Man.</h3>
