<h2>The Sinharaja Forest Reserve</h2>
<p>Sinharaja forest reserve is a valuable biodiversity hotspot in Sri Lanka. It contains a considerable number of flora and fauna which are endemic to Sri Lanka. </p>

<p>However, this reserve is under threat from many sources. The illegal cultvation inside the reserve as well as deforestation for cultivations on the edge are rapidly restroying the land area of the forest. As a direct impact, many of the endemic species are now either under threat of extinction or have gone extinct. While the animals battle with habitat loss, the trees are being cut down for logging. </p>
<p> The reserve is a vital part of the country's biodiversity, weather control and water retention. If the current streak is continued, we will have to face harsher droughts and an utterly unbalanced ecosystem</p>

<h3>Did you know: Sinharaja contains the remnants of "Gondwanaland", a part of the supercontinent "Pangea". It hides some of the clues on how continents drifted and formed the current map of the world.</h3>
