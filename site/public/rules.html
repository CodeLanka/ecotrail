      <ul>
        <li>You must be 16 years or older on 1st January 2018</li>
        <li>You need to solve ALL the steps, in their SET ORDER. If you find the clues of future steps by other channels,

          should not expect that help will be given.</li>
        <li>Participants MUST login at all steps and make sure the login process completes at every step.
          If the login process is aborted or failed, do not proceed to the next step even if you find the clue. Make sure the login
          completes. Failing to do so will risk you from being disqualified.</li>
        <li>Use the same Google account to login to all steps and make sure this account is the one that you will use to redeem the prize</li>

          and the site may go down.</li>
        <li>Any publication made with regard to this competition or a part of it gives GDG Sri Lanka the right to share the publication
          or a part of it on their media channels including the internet with respective credits given to the original author</li>

      <p>Gifts are NON-TRANSFERRABLE. Nobody else may proceed in your place. We will be checking the ID, phone number and email address
        at the entrance. You may have to login to a given webpage at the entrance to verify the ownership of your email.</p>

      <h2>Hints</h2>
      <h3>EcoTrail is NOT RiverSafari or TimeTrek.</h3>
      <p>In the past, we have been trying hard to prevent users from sharing their methods to solve questions. Needless to say, in a vibrant community we ourselves encouraged to share knowledge with others, we would fail to go with that approach. However, failure does not mean we give up. EcoTrail is designed and coded in a way that you would gather up in groups and try solve the clues together. As a result, these steps are hard, and some of them, even harder.</p>
      <p>It is recommended you at least gather up in groups of three people to ensure success. The last clue will require that you have a companion to work with, or you would have to solve the entire puzzle with at least three emails (Something we don't expect you to do, but if you do, please let us know. We would love to hear that story, because it would be very interesting.)</p>
      <p>But getting together in groups does not mean you get to post everything on the internet. Try to keep the competition going. We're looking for people who are techies. Whether you want to give away the opportunity to a freeloader or not is upto you. Its your choice and this time, we would not interfere with that. </p>

      <h3>Ah yes, almost forgot.! the clues go https://ecotrail.gdgsrilanka.org/answer. There are no # signs this time.</h3>
      <h3>Good luck. Hope to see you in Google I/O Extended 2018 Sri Lanka</h3>
