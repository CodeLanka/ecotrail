<h2>Southern Coastline of Sri Lanka</h2>
<p>The Southern coastline of our country is home to many sea-creatures. From them, the deepwater dwelling whale population is one of a kind. </p>
<p>A yet not well understoon phonemenon is supporting many Whales and Dolphins to thrive in the Southern coastline. The abundance of their staple food, Krill, makes this area a hotspot for whales</p>

<p>But several factors threaten their livelihoods. Their habitat is crossed with one of the world's busiest shipping lines. Whales get disorientated with the low frequency sounds which the ships make and oftel collide with them. The next big threat come from us ourselves. Whale watching is done in commercial levels and most of these 'Whale Guides' are typical fishermen who know little about the livelihoods of these gentle giants and they interfere with the feeding and breeding. </p>
<p>Very little is known about this bizzare population of Whales in the area. If adequate action is not taken to take out the threats they face, we might not know anything about them at all.</p>

<h3>Did you know: Despite their size, most Whales feed on one of the smallest animals called Krill. They absorb a vast amount of Krill rich water, and filter out the water so that the small shrimp-like Krill are the only things left. A special membrane in their mouth help to do that filtering efficiently.</h3>
